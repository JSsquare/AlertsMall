History
Early and medieval
Copper plates dated 858 AD and 868 AD show that by the 8th century an agricultural settlement known as Punnaka existed where Pune is today. The plates indicate that this region was ruled by the Rashtrakuta dynasty. The Pataleshwar rock-cut temple complex was built during this era.
Pune was part of the territory ruled by Seuna Yadavas of Devagiri from the 9th century to 1327. In 1595, Maloji Raje Bhosale was appointed the jagirdar of Pune by the Mughal Empire. Construction on the Lal Mahal began in 1631 AD. The Lal Mahal was completed in 1640 AD.
Despite bitter opposition from some Maratha Jagirdars, Shivaji was crowned Chhatrapati in 1674 AD, thus founding the Maratha Empire. He oversaw further development in Pune, including the construction of Guruwar Peth, Somwar Peth, Ganesh Peth, and Ghorpade Peth. Shivaji encouraged the development of dams in Parvati and Kondhwa regions of Pune for agricultural purposes. Pune and its surrounding villages were the major recruitment areas for Shivaji's army between 1645 AD and 1680 AD. Between 1660 AD and 1670 AD the town was captured by Mughal General Shahista Khan, but was recaptured by the Marathas in 1670 AD after the Battle of Sinhagad. Shivaji often used Pune as his transit base during his major campaigns such as Varhad-Karanja, AhemadaNagar District, Karnataka, and Jalna . During the 27-year-long conflict between the Marathas and the Mughals, the town was occupied by Aurangzeb from 1703 to 1705; during this time, the name of the town was changed to "Muhiyabad". Two years later, once again the Marathas recaptured Sinhagad fort and later Pune city from the Mughals after 1670 AD.
Peshwa rule
Chhatrapati Shahu, grandson of Shivaji, realized the importance of Pune and asked most of the Maratha army to be stationed in Pune because of its central location. Various regions such as Konkan, Khandesh, Marathwada, South Maharashtra, North Karnataka can be reached from Pune in just 3 to 4 days. He also asked his army to report to the Peshwa at Pune location for fast expeditions, finances rather than relying on Satara, the seat of the Chhatrapati.
In 1720, Baji Rao I was appointed Peshwa  of the Maratha Empire by Chhatrapati Shahu of Satara. He moved his base from Saswad to Pune and started construction of Shaniwar Wada on the right bank of the Mutha river. The construction was completed in 1730, ushering in the era of Peshwa control of the city. The patronage of the Maratha Peshwas resulted great expansion of Pune with the construction of many temples and bridges in the city, including the Lakdi Pul and the temples on Parvati Hill. Bajirao Peshwa also constructed an underground aqueduct to bring water from Katraj Lake to Shaniwar Wada. The aqueduct is still operational. Pune prospered as a city during the reign of Nanasaheb Peshwa. He developed Saras Baug, Heera Baug, Parvati Hill and new commercial, trading, and residential localities. Sadashiv Peth, Narayan Peth, Rasta Peth, and Nana Peth were developed in this era. The Peshwa's influence in India declined after the defeat of Maratha forces in the Battle of Panipat but Pune remained the seat of power until their final defeat by the British East India Company.
